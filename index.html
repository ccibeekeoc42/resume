            The word <a class="inline-links" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=origin+of+the+word+educate&rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS945US945&oq=origin+of+the+word+educate&aqs=chrome..69i57.5534j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"><em>educate</em></a> comes from the latin word <em>educare</em> which means to <em>bring out</em>.
            I enjoy bringing out the best in people and myself. I also believe in the 70-20-10 rule as we tend to understand 10% of what we study, 20% more by practicing, and the final 70% by teaching.
            Simply put, give whatever you would like to recieve.

          <h3>Traveling, Exploring, and Discovering</h3>
          <p>I believe adventures are one of the best ways to learn and appreciate life. It's oxymoronic that such experiences are both humbling and empowering.
            I believe in a future where the opportunities availabe to every individual is indepedent of their location and situation in life. This is the promise of Artificial Inteligence & the Metaverse.

          <h3>Reading, Researching, and Coding</h3>
          <p>
            The ability to share knowledge across space and time is what seperates humans from other living beings. Books, videos, and other forms of media help capture this sentiment.
            I believe that coding is just as important as speaking any human language. Fun Fact: there are more programable devices than humans in your household. You should learn to communicate with them too.

          <h3>Food, Fitness, and Wellness</h3>
          <p>It's equally as important to nurish the body as well as the mind and there's no better way to bring people together than a shared meal.
            I believe life is so short and uncertain, so please, eat the dessert first. That's a really good euphemism to remind us to enjoy life whenever we can.
            The only thing better than <em>pizza</em> is <em>free pizza & breadsticks</em>.
